Logical Core Utilization: 4.8% (3.062 out of 64)
 | The metric value is low, which may signal a poor logical CPU cores
 | utilization. Consider improving physical core utilization as the first step

 | applications.
 |
    Physical Core Utilization: 4.7% (3.038 out of 64)
     | The metric value is low, which may signal a poor physical CPU cores
     | utilization caused by:
     |     - load imbalance
     |     - threading runtime overhead
     |     - contended synchronization
     |     - thread/process underutilization
     |     - incorrect affinity that utilizes logical cores instead of physical
     |       cores
     | Run the HPC Performance Characterization analysis to estimate the
     | efficiency of MPI and OpenMP parallelism or run the Locks and Waits
     | analysis to identify parallel bottlenecks for other parallel runtimes.

Microarchitecture Usage: 46.4% of Pipeline Slots
 | You code efficiency on this platform is too low.
 | 
 | Possible cause: memory stalls, instruction starvation, branch misprediction
 | or long latency instructions.
 | 
 | Next steps: Run Microarchitecture Exploration analysis to identify the cause
 | of the low microarchitecture usage efficiency.

    Retiring: 46.4% of Pipeline Slots
    Front-End Bound: 2.1% of Pipeline Slots
    Bad Speculation: 0.9% of Pipeline Slots
    Back-End Bound: 50.5% of Pipeline Slots
     | A significant portion of pipeline slots are remaining empty. When
     | operations take too long in the back-end, they introduce bubbles in the
     | pipeline that ultimately cause fewer pipeline slots containing useful
     | work to be retired per cycle than the machine is capable to support. This
     | opportunity cost results in slower execution. Long-latency operations
     | like divides and memory operations can cause this, as can too many
     | operations being directed to a single execution port (for example, more
     | multiply operations arriving in the back-end per cycle than the execution
     | unit can support).
     |
        Memory Bound: 20.1% of Pipeline Slots
         | The metric value is high. This can indicate that the significant
         | fraction of execution pipeline slots could be stalled due to demand
         | memory load and stores. Use Memory Access analysis to have the metric
         | breakdown by memory hierarchy, memory bandwidth information,
         | correlation by memory objects.

                L3 Latency: 2.0% of Clockticks
            DRAM Bound: 12.7% of Clockticks
             | This metric shows how often CPU was stalled on the main memory
             | (DRAM). Caching typically improves the latency and increases
             | performance.
             |
                Memory Bandwidth: 21.4% of Clockticks
                 | Issue: A significant fraction of cycles was stalled due to
                 | approaching bandwidth limits of the main memory (DRAM).
                 | 
                 | Tips: Improve data accesses to reduce cacheline transfers
                 | from/to memory using these possible techniques:
                 |     - Consume all bytes of each cacheline before it is
                 |       evicted (for example, reorder structure elements and
                 |       split non-hot ones).
                 |     - Merge compute-limited and bandwidth-limited loops.
                 |     - Use NUMA optimizations on a multi-socket system.
                 | 
                 | Note: software prefetches do not help a bandwidth-limited
                 | application.
                 |
                Memory Latency: 12.1% of Clockticks
                 | Issue: A significant fraction of cycles was stalled due to
                 | the latency of the main memory (DRAM).
                 | 
                 | Tips: Improve data accesses or interleave them with compute
                 | using such possible techniques as data layout re-structuring
                 | or software prefetches (through the compiler).
                 |
                    Local DRAM: 26.8% of Clockticks
                     | The number of CPU stalls on loads from the local memory
                     | exceeds the threshold. Consider caching data to improve
                     | the latency and increase the performance.
                     |
                    Remote DRAM: 75.5% of Clockticks
                     | The number of CPU stalls on loads from the remote memory
                     | exceeds the threshold. This is often caused by non-
                     | optimal NUMA memory allocations.
                     |
                    Remote Cache: 21.3% of Clockticks
                     | The number of CPU stalls on loads from the remote cache
                     | exceeds the threshold. This is often caused by non-
                     | optimal NUMA memory allocations.

            Store Bound: 2.4% of Clockticks
        Core Bound: 30.4% of Pipeline Slots
         | This metric represents how much Core non-memory issues were of a
         | bottleneck. Shortage in hardware compute resources, or dependencies
         | software's instructions are both categorized under Core Bound. Hence
         | it may indicate the machine ran out of an OOO resources, certain
         | execution units are overloaded or dependencies in program's data- or
         | instruction- flow are limiting the performance (e.g. FP-chained long-
         | latency arithmetic operations).
         |
Memory Bound: 20.1% of Pipeline Slots
 | The metric value is high. This can indicate that the significant fraction of
 | execution pipeline slots could be stalled due to demand memory load and
 | stores. Use Memory Access analysis to have the metric breakdown by memory
 | hierarchy, memory bandwidth information, correlation by memory objects.
 |
    Cache Bound: 8.4% of Clockticks
    DRAM Bound: 12.7% of Clockticks
     | The metric value is high. This indicates that a significant fraction of
     | cycles could be stalled on the main memory (DRAM) because of demand loads
     | or stores.
     |
     | The code is memory bandwidth bound, which means that there are a
     | significant fraction of cycles during which the bandwidth limits of the
     | main memory are being reached and the code could stall. Review the
     | Bandwidth Utilization Histogram to estimate the scale of the issue.
     | Improve data accesses to reduce cacheline transfers from/to memory using
     | these possible techniques: 1) consume all bytes of each cacheline before
     | it is evicted (for example, reorder structure elements and split non-hot
     | ones); 2) merge compute-limited and bandwidth-limited loops; 3) use NUMA
     | optimizations on a multi-socket system.
     |
     | The code is latency bound, which means that there are a significant
     | fraction of cycles during which the code could be stalled due to main
     | memory latency. Consider optimizing data layout or using software
     | prefetches through the compiler to improve cache reuse and to reduce the
     | data fetched from the main memory.
